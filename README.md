# BuildLend — Construction Loan Analyzer

A free tool for real estate developers and investors to analyze construction loan deals, track build expenses, and generate bank-ready reports.

**[Launch the App](https://buildlend.netlify.app)**

## Getting Started

BuildLend is organized into six tabs. Work through them in order for a complete loan package, or jump to any tab you need.

---

## The Six Tabs

### 1. Project
Start here. Fill in your property address, project type, square footage, and bedroom/bath count. Then enter your borrower info, lender name, and loan terms (amount, interest rate, term, origination points, and contingency).

The ARV field here and the one on the Comps tab stay in sync — you only need to set it once.

---

### 2. Budget
Break your costs into three buckets — land & acquisition, hard construction costs, and soft costs. Every line item updates the summary on the right in real time, including:

- **Total project cost**
- **Loan-to-Cost (LTC)** — flagged if it exceeds typical lender thresholds
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**
- **Estimated net profit**

Origination fees, interest carry, and contingency reserve are calculated automatically from your loan terms.

---

### 3. Comps & ARV
Search recent sold properties near your build site to support your After Construction Value.

1. Enter an address or zip code, set your bedroom count, square footage range, and how far back to look
2. Hit **Find Comparable Sales** — results pull from live MLS data
3. Tap any comp card to select it for your analysis
4. Select 3 or more comps for the strongest ARV case — the suggested ARV auto-fills based on your selections
5. You can override the suggested ARV if you have a different figure in mind

---

### 4. Expenses
Log every transaction as your build progresses. For each expense, record the vendor, category, amount, draw number, and whether you have a receipt.

Use the category filter at the top to view expenses by trade (framing, plumbing, electrical, etc.). The progress bar tracks how much of your loan budget has been spent.

---

### 5. Draw Request
Generates a formatted reimbursement request to send your lender. Choose a specific draw period from the dropdown or select "All Draws" for a cumulative view.

Hit **Print** to export as a PDF. The draw request includes a certification statement and signature lines.

---

### 6. Summary
A one-page executive summary of your entire deal — property info, budget breakdown, comp support, key financial ratios, and an automated underwriting assessment that flags strengths and potential concerns.

Hit **Print / PDF** to save or share it with your lender.

## Tips

- **Start with Project and Budget** before searching comps — the app uses your square footage to calculate a suggested ARV from comp data
- **Select at least 3 comps** to generate a credible ARV range
- **Use draw numbers consistently** in the Expense Tracker so your Draw Requests stay organized by phase
- The Summary updates every time you open it, so your latest inputs are always reflected
- Works on mobile — all six tabs are accessible from the bottom navigation bar
